# Statistical modelling of sample size

Let's make *n* draws (a sample) from a Normal distribution with parameters mean *m* and standard deviation *s*.

Let's call error (or "precision") the distance "e" between the average of the sample and its expected average, which is the mean *m*.

- Investigate the link between sample size and error.

- Investigate the link between sample size and st.deviation.
