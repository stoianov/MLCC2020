# Statistical modelling of sampling 

Let's iteratively draw random numbers from a Normal distribution with parameters (mean *m*, standard deviation *s*) until the distance between the average of the drown numbers (sample) and its expected average (the mean *m*) falls bellow a certain threshold called "precision".

- Investigate the potential link between sample size and precision.

- Investigate the link between sample size and the parameter st.dev. *s* of the Normal distribution.
